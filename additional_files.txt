1) the file split_data_shared_K3_parameter.py
will split the data into two sections and use
a shared K3 parameter in simultanois fits of
the two sections.

2) The file derivative_extractor.py will calculate
a dy/dx empirical derivative value for each
data point for use in analysis. This data was
fit to the empirically determined equation
Y = a - (b*X) - arctan(c/(X-d)) where Y
is the derivative at a given value o f M.
Included are the image files  fit_derivative.png
(the fitted derivative) and fit_deriv_error.png
(the errors of that fit). This allows a relatively
accurate rate-of-change to be easily calculated for
any given value of M.

3) The file genetic_algorithm_estimator.py uses scipy's
standard differential_evolution genetic algorithm module
to estimate initial parameter values for the equation

y = K1 * np.exp(-K2 * xdata) + K3 * np.exp(-K4 * xdata)

That scipy module uses the Latin Hypercube algorithm to
ensure a thorough search of parameter space, requiring
bounds within which to search. It is much easier to give
ranges for the initial parameter estimates than specific values.
